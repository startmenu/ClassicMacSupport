<FONT SIZE="4">The Mac OS 9.2.1 Update, improves Classic application compatibility in Mac OS X and delivers updated support for Macintosh systems that are based on the PowerPC G3 or G4 processor.
<p>
This document tells you how to prepare for installing Mac OS 9.2 and gives compatibility information and basic troubleshooting.<BR>
<BR>
Before installing Mac OS 9.2, do these tasks:<BR>
<BR>
&#149; Mac OS 9.2 update requires Mac OS 9.1 if you are performing an auto or manual update.<BR>
<BR>
&#149; If you are installing from the CD, start up your computer using the Mac OS 9.2 CD by inserting the CD and holding down the C key until you see the CD background.<BR>
<BR>
&#149; Turn off any security software that you may have installed on your computer.<BR>
<BR>
&#149; Make sure your system will not go to sleep by dragging the slider in the Energy Saver control panel to &quot;Never.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&#149; If you have a PowerBook, make sure that it is plugged into AC power. <BR>
<BR>
&#149; If you are upgrading from Mac OS 8.1, start up from the Mac OS 9.2 CD. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If you're installing from a network, or if you can't start up from the Mac OS CD, be sure to do the following additional tasks:<BR>
<BR>
&#149; Turn off file sharing.<BR>
<BR>
&#149; Turn off any virus-protection software that you may have installed on your computer.<BR>
<BR>
&#149; Turn off all non-Apple extensions and control panels. Open the Extensions Manager control panel, then open the Selected Set pop-up menu and choose Mac OS All.<BR>
<BR>
&#149; Restart your computer.<BR>
<BR>
To ensure a smooth upgrade, check with the manufacturers of any non-Apple software you use to make sure it is compatible with Mac OS 9.2. If you do experience a problem, see the troubleshooting chapter in your installation manual for information on isolating compatibility problems.  <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>Compatibility information</b><BR>
<BR>
<b>IMPORTANT</b><BR>
&#149; <i>Mac OS 9.2 supports Mac OS X compatible computers</i><BR>
You can install this version of Mac OS 9.2 on any of the following computers: Power Mac G4, Power Macintosh G3, PowerBook G4, PowerBook G3 (except the original PowerBook G3), iMac, and iBook.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&#149; <i>Apple Language Kits and Mac OS 9.2</i><BR>
Apple's language kits are now included with the Mac OS. If you use language kits, you must upgrade both your system software and your language kits at the same time using the Mac OS 9.2 CD. Versions of Apple language kits prior to Mac OS 9.1 (Language Kits 1.1) are not compatible with Mac OS 9.2. To upgrade your system software and language kits, start up from the Mac OS 9.2 CD by inserting the CD and holding down the C key as you restart the computer. Continue holding down the C key until you see the CD background. Open the Mac OS Installer and click Customize in the Install Software panel. Select both the Mac OS Install and Language Kits, and remember to select the specific language kits you want to upgrade.<BR>
<BR>
&#149; <i>Apple Language Kits and ATM Deluxe 4.5</i><BR>
ATM Deluxe 4.5 is not compatible with WorldScript I, the system extension used to support certain languages in Mac OS. Use ATM Deluxe 4.6 or later if you plan on using any of the following language kits: Arabic, Hebrew, Devanagari, Gurmukhi, or Gujarati.<BR>
<BR>
&#149; <i?GX desktop printers</i><BR>
If you have a GX desktop printer set up on your hard disk, a crash may occur during installation of Mac OS 9.2. Drag the GX desktop printer icon to the trash before you install.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>If you are upgrading from Mac OS 8.1</b><BR>
<BR>
&#149; <i>Third-party Finder and utility software</i><BR>
Some third-party programs that extend or add features to the Mac OS may be incompatible with Mac OS 9.2. Examples include programs that change the way menus work, change how files are stored, or alter the way you work with files in the Finder. Contact the software's manufacturer for information about using such programs with Mac OS 9.2. This is especially important if you're using a program that automatically alters the way files are stored (such as compressing them) because you might not be able to access those files until you obtain updated software for use with Mac OS 9.2.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>Tips and troubleshooting suggestions</b><BR>
<BR>
If you experience problems during installation, be sure to start up with the Mac OS CD by inserting the CD and holding down the C key as you restart the computer. Continue holding down the C key until you see the CD background.<BR>
<BR>
<i>Finding folders</i><BR>
The folder structure in Mac OS 9.2 makes it easier to find all your files and applications. Here are some changes you'll notice: the Applications folder is named &quot;Applications (Mac OS 9);&quot; the Apple Extras and Utilities folders are in the Applications (Mac OS 9) folder; Netscape Communicator and Internet Explorer are in the Applications (Mac OS 9) folder. Browse your hard disk to get familiar with your new Mac OS, and use Sherlock to locate all your files and folders.<BR>
<BR>
<i>Updating your disk drivers</i><BR>
Some Apple-branded disks manufactured by third parties are not supported by the Apple disk utilities. If your disk cannot be updated with the Apple utilities, you&#146;ll need to use a third-party disk utility to update the driver. <BR>
<BR>
<i>Repairing disks</i><BR>
If you see a message that your disk has problems and cannot be repaired, make sure file sharing is off, then try installing again. If that doesn&#146;t work, try using another disk-repair utility. If you don&#146;t have another utility, or if that utility also doesn&#146;t work, you may need to reinitialize the disk. Copy all your files to another disk first, as reinitializing erases the disk. For more information about reinitializing, see the manual that came with your computer. <BR>
<BR>
<i>Updating your firmware</i><BR>
If you receive a message during installation that your firmware is out of date, follow the instructions for updating your firmware in the CD Extras folder on your Mac OS CD, or go to www.apple.com to find the latest firmware update.<BR>
<BR>
Additional troubleshooting information is available in the pdf file, Installing Mac OS 9.2, located on the CD.
