<FONT SIZE="4">This document tells you how to prepare for installing this Mac OS 9 Update and gives compatibility information and basic troubleshooting.
<p>
Before installing, do these tasks:
<p>
&#149; This update requires Mac OS 9.2.1 if you are performing an auto or manual update.
<p>
&#149; Turn off any security software that you may have installed on your computer.
<p>
&#149; Make sure your system will not go to sleep by dragging the slider in the Energy Saver control panel to "Never." 
<p>
&#149; If you have a PowerBook, make sure that it is plugged into AC power. 
<p>
<p>
If you're installing from a network, or if you can't start up from a Mac OS 9 CD, be sure to do the following additional tasks:
<p>
&#149; Turn off file sharing.
<p>
&#149; Turn off any virus-protection software that you may have installed on your computer.
<p>
&#149; Turn off all non-Apple extensions and control panels. Open the Extensions Manager control panel, then open the Selected Set pop-up menu and choose Mac OS All.
<p>
&#149; Restart your computer.
<p>
To ensure a smooth upgrade, check with the manufacturers of any non-Apple software you use to make sure it is compatible with Mac OS 9.2. If you do experience a problem, see the troubleshooting chapter in your installation manual for information on isolating compatibility problems. 
<p>
<p>
<b>Compatibility information</b>
<p>
Mac OS 9.2 supports Mac OS X compatible computers
You can install this version of Mac OS 9.2 on any of the following computers: Power Mac G4, Power
Macintosh G3, PowerBook G4, PowerBook G3 (except the original PowerBook G3), iMac, and iBook.
<p>
<b>Tips and troubleshooting suggestions</b>
<p>
If you experience problems during installation, be sure to start from Mac OS 9.2.1 with extensions off and try again. Turn extensions off using the Extensions Manager or by holding down the Shift key as you restart the computer. Continue holding down the Shift key until you see the words "Extensions Off" on the 9.2 splash screen.
<p>
<i>Third-party software</i>
Some third-party programs that extend or add features to the Mac OS may be incompatible with Mac OS 9.2. Examples include programs that change the way menus work, change how files are stored, or alter the way you work with files in the Finder. Contact the software's manufacturer for information about using such programs with Mac OS 9.2. This is especially important if you're using a program that automatically alters the way files are stored (such as compressing them) because you might not be able to access those files until you
obtain updated software for use with Mac OS 9.2.
<p>
<i>Finding folders</i>
The folder structure in Mac OS 9.2 makes it easier to find all your files and applications. Here are some changes you'll notice: the Applications folder is named "Applications (Mac OS 9);" the Apple Extras and Utilities folders are in the Applications (Mac OS 9) folder; Netscape Communicator and Internet Explorer are in the Applications (Mac OS 9) folder. Browse your hard disk to get familiar with your new Mac OS, and use Sherlock to locate all your files and folders.
<p>
<i>Updating your disk drivers</i>
Some Apple-branded disks manufactured by third parties are not supported by the Apple disk utilities. If your disk cannot be updated with the Apple utilities, you'll need to use a third-party disk utility to update the driver. 
<p>
<i>Repairing disks</i>
If you see a message that your disk has problems and cannot be repaired, make sure file sharing is off, then try installing again. If that doesn't work, try using another disk-repair utility. If you don't have another utility, or if that utility also doesn't work, you may need to reinitialize the disk. Copy all your files to another disk first, as reinitializing erases the disk. For more information about reinitializing, see the manual that came with your computer.
